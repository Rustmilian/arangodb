description: |
  This metric shows the total number of entries for which no automatic refilling
  happened in the in-memory edge cache.
  This counter increases only for insert, update, replace, and remove operations
  affecting edge indexes and with requested automatic refilling,
  if no refill operation could be queued due to capacity constraints.
  A refill operation request can be rejected if the number of currently queued
  refill operations exceeds the maximum value configured via the
  `--rocksdb.auto-refill-index-cache-queue-capacity` startup option.
  Correctness of index lookups is not affected if this metric is non-zero, as
  it only reports the number of failed refilling attempts in the in-memory cache
  of any edge index. This in-memory cache is optional and its fill grade does not
  affect correctness.

  If this metric keeps increasing, it indicates that the index refill background 
  threads can't keep up with the incoming data modification requests. 
  In this case, consider increasing the background threads' queueing capacity via
  the `--rocksdb.auto-refill-index-cache-queue-capacity` startup option, or the
  number of background threads via the `--rocksdb.auto-refill-background-threads`
  startup options.
  Increasing the capacity or number of threads helps to handle bursts of requests, 
  but does not help if the background threads are overwhelmed by a continuous high
  load.
